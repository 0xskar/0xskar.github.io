  MessageBoxA((HWND)0x0,local_8,"We\'ve been compromised!",0x30);
```

the entry function is calling these variables which look like hex. lets put them together and see what we get.

`F 0x4c 0x41 0x47 0x7b 0x53 0x54 0x41 0x43 0x4b 0x2d 0x53 0x54 0x52 0x49 0x4e 0x47 0x53 0x2d 0x41 0x52 0x45 0x2d 0x42 0x45 0x53 0x54 0x2d 0x53 0x54 0x52 0x49 0x4e 0x47 0x53 0x7d`
