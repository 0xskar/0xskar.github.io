Tryhackme's sequel to their [crackthehash level 1](https://tryhackme.com/room/crackthehash). The last ones baby you through pretty good so lets see if this is a challenge. They say password cracking is part of a pentesters job, but I am not one, hopefully someday. It seems interesting.

## Hash Identification

Going to identify hashes here, different types MD5, SHA1, SHA2, SQL, hashcat has a lot of good examples, theres lots of websites to help with identification as well. Some other commands I've used are `hash-identifier`, and `hashcat`.
