## Understand the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes.

Single qustes denote strings that are to be interpreted literally.

Double quotes denote strings that may contain variable substitutions.

Backtick quotes are used to denote strings that span multiple lines.

The main difference between single and double quotes in JavaScript is that with double quotes, string interpolation is possible. This means that you can embed variables within a double-quoted string that will be evaluated and replaced with their values. You can't do this with single quotes.

Here is an example:

```javascript
var myName = "Bob";

console.log(`My name is ${myName}.`);
// Prints: My name is Bob.

console.log('My name is ' + myName + '.');
// Prints: My name is Bob.
```
