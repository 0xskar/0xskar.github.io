The Pyramid of pain visualizes the level of difficulty it will cause for an adversary to change the indicators associated with them, and their attack campaign. 

## Hash Values (Trivial)

A hash is the result of a hashing algorithm. A hash value is a unique value that identifies data. Some of the most common hashing algorithms are:

- **MD5 (Message Digest)** - Designed in 1992 and is a widely used cryptographic hash function with a 128-bit hash. **NOT** considered cryptographically secure. Vulnerable against a number of attacks including hash collision. Hash collision is when two different input values create the same hash. This can be used by an attacker to create a rogue version of the hash and use that hash to gain access to the legitimate file with the same MD5 hash.
- **SHA-1 (Secure Hashing Algorithm 1)** - Was designed by the bad guys at the NSA. of couse they build backdoors into algorithm just like the CIA did. It's not secure and banned for its use now because it's succeptable to brute force attacks.
- **SHA-2 (Secure Hashing Algorihm 2)** - Designed by the NIST and the NSA (uh-oh) to replace SHA-1. It has lots of variants, the most comming being SHA-256. The SHA-256 algo returns a hash value of 256-bits as a 64 digit hexadecimal number.

Like we said before about MD5 - a hash is not considered to be cryptographically secure if it two files are able to have the same hash value or digest. The main difference between a hash digest and a hash value is that a digest is the output of a specific hashing algorithm, while a hash value can be generated by any hashing algorithm.

You can use the hash values of files to determine if the file is malicious as they are unique.

We can use online tooks to do hash lookups, such as:- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com), and [Metadefender Cloud - OPSWAT](https://metadefender.opswat.com/?lang=en).

Now as we can see its pretty easy to determine if a file is malicious or not if we have its hash right? Wrong. It is trivial for an attacker to modify malware if they know what they are going and they can easily modify just a character in the code to produce a new hash value, which makes threat hunting using file hashes a very difficult task.

## IP Address (Easy)

IP addresses are used to identify any decive connected to any network. From a defenders standpoint knowing where the malicious attacks are coming from is super valuable. If we have an IP address we can block, drop, or deny requests from them via a firewall. This tactic only works until the attacker can find another IP address and an experienced attacker has no trouble getting a new one.

One way an attacker can make it challenging for a defender to successfully IP block is by using **Fast Flux**.

Fast Flux is a DNS technique used by botnets to hide phishing, web proxying, malware delivery and malware communication by hiding behind compromised hosts acting as proxies. The purpose of using Fast flux is to make the communication between malware and command and control centers challenging to be discovered by the SOC.

[Fast Flux 101: How Cybercriminals Improve the Resilience of Their Infrastructure to Evade Detection and Law Enforcement Takedowns](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/fast-flux-101/)

The concent of fast flux is having many different IP addresses that are associated with a domain name which is constantly changing.

## Domain Names (Simple)

Domain names are a little harder for an attacker to change as they will have to purchase new domain, register it, then modidy the DNS records. Also because DNS providers care more about money then security they have loose standards and supply APIs which make it fairly easy and fast for an experienced attacked to change the domain.

Attackers can use a few tricks to hide their domain names from the uninformed. They can use [Punycode](https://www.wandera.com/punycode-attacks/) to redirect users to a malicious domain name that looks legitimate at the first glance. For example a URL that looks like `adıdas.de` will actually take you to `http://xn--addas-o4a.de/`

To detect malicious domains we can check proxy or server logs.

Attackers can also hide their domains using URL Shorteners, such as:

   - bit.ly
   - goo.gl
   - ow.ly
   - s.id
   - smarturl.it
   - tiny.pl
   - tinyurl.com
   - x.co

You can see where the shortened link will send you by appending "+" to it. Ex: `goo.gl/mcvc4mc+` or `bit.ly/mvJm43+`

## Host Artifacts (Annoying)

At the upper part of the pyramid attackers will be getting more and more annoyed if we can detect these attacks. If we can detect at this level the attacker will need to go back to their previous steps and change their attack tools and methods. This can be time-consuming for the attacker.

Host artifacts are traces or observables that the attackers have left on the system, like registry values, sus process executions, IOCs (Indicators of Compromise), files, or anything releated to the threat.

So a suspicious process execution followed by a series of strange events would be a good sign that we have come accross some host artifact.

## Network Artifacts (Annoying)
