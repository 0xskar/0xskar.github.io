We see a few ports off of the nmap scan then see a hint of a development site on the main webpage. The mainpage also mentions their head of IT Angoose Garden...

```bash 
wfuzz -c -t 50 -u http://stocker.htb -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.stocker.htb"  --hw 12
```

This points us to a login page. Caputuring the login request in burp.
